The program gets a string, 2 indexes & a number (len),
and checks if the memory segments from each index are equals (len bytes from any index).

Please insert the number of bytes to check.
The length must be an integer and non-negative,
and the mximum bytes are 512 (minus each index):

Please insert the first index.
The index must be an integer an non-negative:

Please insert the second index.
The index must be an integer an non-negative:

Please insert a string (Max length = 512):
The values you entered:
The string: AAAAFAFAFAFA
The First index: 2.
The second index: 5.
The length is: 0
The memory segments are equals.
