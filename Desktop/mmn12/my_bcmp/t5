and checks if the memory segments from each index are equals (len bytes from any index).

Please insert the number of bytes to check.
The length must be an integer and non-negative,
and the mximum bytes are 512 (minus each index):

Please insert the first index.
The index must be an integer an non-negative:

Please insert the second index.
The index must be an integer an non-negative:

Please insert a string (Max length = 512):
Error! The first index is not an integer or non-negative.


Error! The second index is not an integer or non-negative.


Error! The length is not an integer or non-negative.
